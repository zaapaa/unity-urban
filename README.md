# Urban War 

FPS/RTS Game concept, inspired by old Microsoft game Urban Assault

Solo project

### What is this?
* Game goal is to destroy enemy base (represented by gray cubes)
* Summon tanks and send them to enemy base
* Tanks move to attack range attack enemy tanks automatically (after they think about it for a few seconds..)
* Enemy AI summons tanks whenever it has enough energy and sends them to your base in waves of 3 tanks
* Pathfinding using Unity's pathfinding feature, with areas and stuff
* Energy regenerates based on distance from power station (the white thing under bases), which can also be destroyed (I think..)
